# dipy-wrappers

My wrappers for dipy white matter modeling and tractography.  Check out [dipy.org](https://dipy.org/) for the latest and greatest. These wrappers and scripts draw heavily from the provided [Dipy examples](https://dipy.org/tutorials/). 

These set of scripts were primarily developed around the time of Dipy version 1.1, which has been surpassed.
