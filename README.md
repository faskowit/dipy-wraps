# dipy-wrappers

My wrappers for Dipy (Diffusion Imaging in Python) white matter modeling and tractography.  Check out [dipy.org](https://dipy.org/) for the latest and greatest. These wrappers and scripts draw heavily from the provided [Dipy examples](https://dipy.org/tutorials/). If you use Dipy, you should cite the [original Dipy paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2014.00008/full) plus any of the methods implemented, which include advanced white matter model fitting and tractography.  

These set of scripts were primarily developed around the time of Dipy version 1.1 (and before), which has been surpassed. 

Use these scripts at your discretion (see license), and please quality-control and double-check the outputs. 

Cheers!
